My Fedora 32 .bashrc file

This file is my current .bashrc file on my Fedora 32 workstation machine. Comment out the environment variables if you do not want any errors. This is just meant to be a suggestion/guide for people who are starting to make C and Fortran libraries and do not want to deal with writing the entire path to their library files when compiling/linking.
